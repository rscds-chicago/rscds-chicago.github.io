<i>From the East</i><br>
To come to the Barn, take I-88 to the Route 59 exit. Exit and turn right, going north on Rt. 59. Go to Batavia Road (the 4<sup>th</sup> light) and turn left. Enter Fermilab through the gate (you will need to stop, tell the guard you are coming to Scottish dancing, and show identification, e.g. a driver's license) and proceed to the first stop sign at Sauk Blvd. Turn right. The Barn is the second building on your right. There is a parking lot just beyond it to the north. Walk up the ramp to enter.<br><br>
Alternatively, take North Avenue, Route 64, west to Route 59. Go south on Rt. 59, passing through West Chicago, until you arrive at the intersection with Batavia Road (the next light after Mack Road), in Warrenville. Turn right on Batavia Road and proceed as above.

<i>From the West</i><br>
Exit I-88 at Farnsworth Av. which becomes Kirk Rd. Go north, passing the outlet mall, and crossing Butterfield Road, past several stoplights, to the entrance to Fermilab at Pine St. Turn right and enter the lab (you will need to stop, tell the guard you are coming to Scottish dancing, and show identification, e.g. a driver's license). Drive east across the main road, passing stop signs by the high-rise, another stop sign by the CDF buildings, a blinking red light at Eola Road, and continue on to the next stop sign by the houses of the "Village". (If you go too far, you'll get to the East gate to the lab at Batavia Road.) Turn left at this stop sign to go north on Sauk Blvd. The Barn is the 2<sup>nd</sup> building on your right. There is a parking lot just beyond it to the north. Walk up the ramp to enter.<br><br>
Alternatively, take Route 64 (=North Avenue) or Route 38 (=Roosevelt Road) to Kirk Road and go south to Pine St, which is one light south of Wilson St., or 3 lights south of the intersection of Fabyan Parkway and Kirk Road. Turn left at Pine St to enter Fermilab and proceed as above.
