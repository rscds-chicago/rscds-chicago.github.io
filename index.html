Scottish Country Dancing is the ballroom dancing of Scotland.
It draws from French traditional dance steps for quicktime dances and the uniquely Scottish
strathspey tempo for slower, more stately, dances.
Scottish Country Dancing is performed in couples, most frequently in sets of four couples
arranged in lines of women facing men, but is also danced in square or other-shaped sets.
Each tempo has two basic steps: traveling and setting steps, and dances are generally danced in
groups of 8-bar figures.

The Chicago Branch sponsors two general SCD classes in the greater Chicago area: Loch Michigan, and Silk and Thistle, and one technique class for advanced dancers.
